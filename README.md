# 3d-on-2d-canvas

## The idea
I will be using this repo as a notebook for all my progress and the things i learn as i try to enter in the world of 3D computer rendered graphics. I will try to make a simple 3D engine from the ground using my programming lenguage of choice (javascript) without knowing anything about how 3D graphics works in the computational world.

## The reference
I'm using the book "Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics - Third Edition" as my point of reference and as a kind of a guide for me to construct and idea on how my approach would be for this topic.
