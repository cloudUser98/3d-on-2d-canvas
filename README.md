# 3d-on-2d-canvas

## The idea
I will be using this repo as a notebook for all my progress and the things i learn as i try to enter in the world of 3D computer rendered graphics. I will try to make a simple 3D engine from the ground using my programming lenguage of choice (javascript) without knowing anything about how 3D graphics works in the computational world.
